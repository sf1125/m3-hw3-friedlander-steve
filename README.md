The issues I had were getting the background image, header background, and light gray background to span the width of the page.
I fixed it as per Professor's advice of creating a seperate div before the container for the background color. I also 
fixed the header and background image issues by using container-jumbo. I was also trying to vertically align the logo thinking that 
the requirement was that it be done via bootstrap tags. I ended up using padding instead.

I used the following resources:
